# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 4.2.1 - Advanced Logic - Boolean Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use boolean operators to enhance the functionality of if then blocks.

We will create a program which will use an IF THEN ELSE statement and some boolean operators to check what time of day is in our game and let the player know if its morning, afternoon, evening or night time.

In this program we will create a variable to track the number of blocks placed which we will update when we lay or destroy a block of our chosen type. When this variable reaches a value which is divisible by 5 we will tell the player the total number of blocks currently placed.

In Minecraft the games runs a day night cycle which lasts 20 minutes in the real world. Time is measured in ticks in Minecraft with the day starting at 0 and the end of the day being 24000 ticks.

The below table shows some notable time points in the game with their equivalent Minecraft and Real World times which will be handy later.

## Step 2
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` event block and set it to respond to the command **time**
#### ~ tutorialhint
Open the PLAYER drawer and place a on chat command "jump" anywhere on the blue area
```blocks
player.onChat("time",function () {
 
})

```
## Step 3
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer drag out an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block and place it inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "time"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (true) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})

```

## Step 4
Replace the default true block with a boolean ``||LOGIC:AND||`` block from the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (false && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})


```

## Step 5
From the Logic drawer place a ``||LOGIC: 0 = 0 ||`` comparison block in the first part of the boolean and block and change its comparison operator to the greater than or equal to operator.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (0 >= 0 && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 6
From the ``||GAMEPLAY:GAMEPLAY||`` drawer place a ``||GAMEPLAY:time query daytime||`` block in the first comparison block of the greater than or equal to comparison operator block.

The time query gametime block tells us the current game time in ticks.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) >= 0 && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```
## Step 7
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer place a ``||LOGIC: 0 = 0 ||``comparison block in the second part of the boolean and block and change its comparison operator to the less than or equal to operator.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) >= 0 && 0 <= 0) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 8
As before from the ``||GAMEPLAY:GAMEPLAY||`` drawer place a ``||GAMEPLAY:time query daytime||`` block in the first comparison block of the less than or equal to comparison operator block.

Change the numeric value in the second comparison block to 6000.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) >= 0 && gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) <= 6000) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 9
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER:say "hi"||`` block inside the IF block and change the text to "Its morning!".

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("time", function () {
    if (gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) >= 0 && gameplay.timeQuery(DAY_TIME) <= 6000) {
        player.say("Its morning!")
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```
## Step 10
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 11 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon. Change the current game time by running the slash command **/time set 4000**

3.  Open the **chat window** and enter the word **time** and press enter.

A message saying "Its morning" should appear.

## Step 12
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 13 @tutorialCompleted
