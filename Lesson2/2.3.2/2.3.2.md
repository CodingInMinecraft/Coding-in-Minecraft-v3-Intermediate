# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2 - Activity 6

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
At the moment if the agent moves forward, the back count stays the same. 

We will create some code to subtract 1 from the ``||VARIABLES:steps||`` variable when the agent moves forward.

```template
player.onChat("back",function () {
	agent.move(BACK, 1)
    steps += 1
    player.say("steps")
})
```

## Step 2
Drag out an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block from the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer and change it to respond to forward.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    
})

```
## Step 3
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer drag out an agent move forward by 1 block and place it in the new ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})

```

## Step 4
Drag out a change steps by 1 block from the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer. 
Change the 1 to a negative 1 by adding a minus sign in front of the 1.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    steps += -1
    
})
```

## Step 5
Drag a ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block from the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer and place it in the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "back"||`` block.
Then, drag a ``||VARIABLES:steps||`` block from the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer and drop it on the  ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    steps += -1
    player.say(steps)
})
```

## Step 6
Next, let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 7 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.
![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson2/2.1.1/images/2.jpg?raw=true "Start")

2. Press the **T** key on the keyboard to bring up the chat window and type **back** and press  the Enter key.
The agent should move back by 1 and the player should say 1.  

3. Repeat that step and you should see the player say 2 and the agent move back by 1. 

4. Then, press the **T** key on the keyboard to bring up the chat window and type **forward** and press the Enter key.
The agent should move forward by 1 and the player should say 1. 


## Step 8
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected  press C to come back and continue this activity. 

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 9
Let's try a simple loop to make this move more automated. (You will learn more about loops in the coming lessons.)

We are going to use a repeat loop around the code inside both chat commands so we don't have to type the directions so many times. 

Start by going to the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer and dragging out a ``||LOOPS:Repeat||`` block. 
Place it around everything inside of the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "back"||`` block.
Change the number 4 to a 3. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("back", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        agent.move(BACK, 1)
        steps += 1
        player.say(steps)
    }
})
```
## Step 10
Drag another ``||LOOPS:Repeat||`` block out and place around everything inside of the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "forward"||`` block.
Change the number 4 to a 2. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
        steps += -1
        player.say(steps)
    }
})
```
## Step 11

## Step 12 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Press the **T** key on the keyboard to bring up the chat window and type **back** and press  the Enter key.
The agent should move back by 3 and the player should say 3.  

4. Then, press the **T** key on the keyboard to bring up the chat window and type **forward** and press the Enter key.
The agent should move forward by 2 and the player should say 1. 

## Step 13 
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 14 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non player character.
