# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2 - Activity 5

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we perform some mathematical calculations on a variable to count the number of steps back the agent takes. 


## Step 2
Create a Variable named **steps** using the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer.

## Step 3
If your workspace doesn't already have one, add an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block. 
Change it to respond to the command **back**.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("back",function () {
	
})

```

## Step 4
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer drag out an agent move forward by 1 block and place it in the ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block.
Change forward to back.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("back",function () {
	agent.move(BACK, 1)
})

```
## Step 5
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer drag out change item by 1 block and place it in the ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block.

Change the variable to the ``||VARIABLES:steps||`` variable created earlier.

This will update the value of steps by 1 every time the agent takes a step backwards.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("back",function () {
	agent.move(BACK, 1)
    steps += 1
})

```


## Step 6
Drag a ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block from the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer and place it in the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "back"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("back",function () {
	agent.move(BACK, 1)
    steps += 1
    player.say(":)")
})


```
## Step 7
Drag a ``||VARIABLES:steps||`` block from the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer and drop it on the  ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("back",function () {
	agent.move(BACK, 1)
    steps += 1
    player.say(steps)
})

```

## Step 8
Next, let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 10 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

** HINT - If you don't see your agent, move into the activity zone and press C again.**

2. Press the **T** key on the keyboard to bring up the chat window and type **back** and press  the Enter key.
The agent should move back by 1 and the player should say 1.

3. Repeat that step and you should see the player say 2 and the agent move back by 1.

4. You can repeat a third time to see the player say 3 and the agent move back again by 1.

## Step 11
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 12 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next activity.
